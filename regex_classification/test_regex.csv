0,"The dialogue above is from ELIZA, an early natural language processing system ELIZA that could carry on a limited conversation with a user by imitating the responses of a Rogerian psychotherapist (Weizenbaum, 1966). ELIZA is a surprisingly simple program that uses pattern matching to recognize phrases like \""I need X\"" and translate them into suitable outputs like \""What would it mean to you if you got X?\"". This simple technique succeeds in this domain because ELIZA doesn't actually need to know anything to mimic a Rogerian psychotherapist. As Weizenbaum notes, this is one of the few dialogue genres where listeners can act as if they know nothing of the world. Eliza's mimicry of human conversation was remarkably successful: many people who interacted with ELIZA came to believe that it really understood them and their problems, many continued to believe in ELIZA's abilities even after the program's operation was explained to them (Weizenbaum, 1976), and even today such chatbots are a fun diversion."
1,"Of course modern conversational agents are much more than a diversion; they can answer questions, book flights, or find restaurants, functions for which they rely on a much more sophisticated understanding of the user's intent, as we will see in Chapter 24. Nonetheless, the simple pattern-based methods that powered ELIZA and other chatbots play a crucial role in natural language processing."
2,"We'll begin with the most important tool for describing text patterns: the regular expression. Regular expressions can be used to specify strings we might want to extract from a document, from transforming \""I need X\"" in Eliza above, to defining strings like $199 or $24.99 for extracting tables of prices from a document."
3,"We'll then turn to a set of tasks collectively called text normalization, in which regular expressions play an important part. Normalizing text means converting it to a more convenient, standard form. For example, most of what we are going to do with language relies on first separating out or tokenizing words from running text, the task of tokenization. English words are often separated from each other by whitespace, but whitespace is not always sufficient. New York and rock 'n' roll are sometimes treated as large words despite the fact that they contain spaces, while sometimes we'll need to separate I'm into the two words I and am. For processing tweets or texts we'll need to tokenize emoticons like :) or hashtags like #nlproc. 2.1 \u2022 REGULAR EXPRESSIONS 3 Some languages, like Japanese, don't have spaces between words, so word tokenization becomes more difficult."
4,"Another part of text normalization is lemmatization, the task of determining that two words have the same root, despite their surface differences. For example, the words sang, sung, and sings are forms of the verb sing. The word sing is the common lemma of these words, and a lemmatizer maps from all of these to sing. Lemmatization is essential for processing morphologically complex languages like Arabic. Stemming refers to a simpler version of lemmatization in which we mainly just strip suffixes from the end of the word. Text normalization also includes sentence segmentation: breaking up a text into individual sentences, using cues like periods or exclamation points."
5,"Finally, we'll need to compare words and other strings. We'll introduce a metric called edit distance that measures how similar two strings are based on the number of edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) it takes to change one string into the other. Edit distance is an algorithm with applications throughout language processing, from spelling correction to speech recognition to coreference resolution."
6,"One of the unsung successes in standardization in computer science has been the regular expression (RE), a language for specifying text search strings. This prac-regular expression tical language is used in every computer language, word processor, and text processing tools like the Unix tools grep or Emacs. Formally, a regular expression is an algebraic notation for characterizing a set of strings. They are particularly useful for searching in texts, when we have a pattern to search for and a corpus of texts to search through. A regular expression search function will search through the corpus, returning all texts that match the pattern. The corpus can be a single document or a collection. For example, the Unix command-line tool grep takes a regular expression and returns every line of the input document that matches the expression."
7,"A search can be designed to return every match on a line, if there are more than one, or just the first match. In the following examples we generally underline the exact part of the pattern that matches the regular expression and show only the first match. We'll show regular expressions delimited by slashes but note that slashes are not part of the regular expressions."
8,"Regular expressions come in many variants. We'll be describing extended regular expressions; different regular expression parsers may only recognize subsets of these, or treat some expressions slightly differently. Using an online regular expression tester is a handy way to test out your expressions and explore these variations."
9,"The simplest kind of regular expression is a sequence of simple characters. To search for woodchuck, we type /woodchuck/. The expression /Buttercup/ matches any string containing the substring Buttercup; grep with that expression would return the line I'm called little Buttercup. The search string can consist of a single character (like /!/) or a sequence of characters (like /urgl/)."
