This repo is testing out the feature to pull a model from github to then be deployed via kserve within a kubeflow cluster.

sklearn directory contains model resources for sklearn model. The model is trained on the iris dataset and is used for testing the kserve deployment.

Readme will contain instructions as well - still wip. 

Pre-trained model directory is work in progress.
